# Developer Guide for Messaging Solutions

This document provides a developer-focused overview of major messaging solutions, including language support, ease of integration, and developer tooling.

## Platform Support

| Product        | Language/SDK Support                     | Ease of Integration       | Local Dev Experience | Documentation & Community |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Apache Kafka   | Java, Python, Go, C/C++, .NET, Node.js   | Moderate (client libraries, REST proxy) | Docker images, local clusters | Extensive, large OSS community |
| RabbitMQ       | Java, Python, Go, .NET, Ruby, PHP, Node.js | Easy (AMQP, many clients, REST API) | Docker, easy local start | Excellent, active community |
| Apache Pulsar  | Java, Python, Go, C++, Node.js, REST     | Moderate (client libraries, REST, Pulsar Functions) | Docker Compose, local cluster | Good, growing OSS community |
| NATS           | Go, Java, Python, .NET, Rust, Node.js    | Easy (simple API, CLI tools) | NATS Server Docker  | Growing, clear docs        |
| Redis Streams  | All major languages (via libraries)      | Easy (simple commands)    | Docker, Redis Stack   | Excellent, huge OSS support |
| MQTT           | All major languages (via libraries)      | Easy (simple protocol)    | Mosquitto/EMQX Docker | Good, many guides         |
| AWS SQS/SNS    | All AWS SDKs, REST API                   | Very Easy (SDKs, console, CLI) | Localstack for local dev | Excellent, AWS docs        |
| IBM MQ         | Java, JMS, .NET, C/C++, REST             | Moderate (JMS, APIs, MQI) | Docker image, local install | Good, enterprise docs       |
| Solace         | Java, C, .NET, Python, Go, JavaScript, REST | Moderate (SDKs, REST, MQTT, JMS) | Free dev edition, Docker | Good, enterprise support |
