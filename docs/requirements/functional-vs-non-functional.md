# Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements

This section helps distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements to aid in the selection of an appropriate messaging system.

## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the specific behaviors, features, and functions a messaging system must provide. They are the foundational capabilities enabling the system to operate as intended. Key aspects include:

- **Message Delivery**
  - *Scenario*: A retail platform ensuring orders are received and processed by fulfillment centers.
  - *Key Questions*: Are messages guaranteed to be delivered? What happens if delivery fails?

- **Supported Messaging Patterns**
  - *Scenario*: A financial service using request-reply for transaction validations.
  - *Key Questions*: Which messaging patterns are crucial? Do they align with business processes?

- **Integration**
  - *Scenario*: An IoT system connecting sensors to analytics platforms.
  - *Key Questions*: What protocols are necessary for seamless integration? Are there existing API dependencies?

- **Message Routing**
  - *Scenario*: A media company distributing live sports feed to multiple outlets.
  - *Key Questions*: How are messages routed within the network? Is content-based filtering needed?

- **Persistence**
  - *Scenario*: A critical alert system retaining messages until acknowledgment.
  - *Key Questions*: How long must messages be stored? What backup mechanisms exist?

- **Error Handling**
  - *Scenario*: A logistics system retrying failed deliveries automatically.
  - *Key Questions*: Are retries automatic or manual? How are failures logged and reviewed?

- **User Authentication**
  - *Scenario*: A secure messaging platform authorizing financial transactions.
  - *Key Questions*: What authentication methods are supported? Are there multi-factor options?

- **Monitoring and Logging**
  - *Scenario*: A network provider tracking data transfer rates and message lags.
  - *Key Questions*: What metrics are tracked in real-time? How are logs accessed and analyzed?

- **Administration Tools**
  - *Scenario*: An enterprise IT team managing access control policies and system alerts.
  - *Key Questions*: How intuitive are the management interfaces? What controls are available for admins?

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify the quality attributes, performance, and constraints of the system, often defining how it achieves the intended functionality. They are critical for ensuring user satisfaction and operational efficiency:

- **Scalability**
  - *Metric*: Ability to scale horizontally, supporting growth from 10,000 to 1 million users.
  - *Benchmark*: Kubernetes deployment achieving automatic scaling.
  - *Decision Guide*: Assess horizontal vs. vertical scaling based on expected growth.

- **Latency**
  - *Metric*: Average message delay not exceeding 50ms.
  - *Benchmark*: Low-latency networks for high-frequency trading.
  - *Decision Guide*: Prioritize for real-time systems and adjust commitment accordingly.

- **Throughput**
  - *Metric*: Capability to handle up to 1 million messages per second.
  - *Benchmark*: Stress test results under peak load conditions.
  - *Decision Guide*: Align with expected message volume during peak times.

- **Reliability**
  - *Metric*: 99.999% success rate with failover mechanisms.
  - *Benchmark*: Dual data centers enabling active-active clustering.
  - *Decision Guide*: Implement failover strategies matching service continuity needs.

- **Availability**
  - *Metric*: 99.99% uptime with automated recovery processes.
  - *Benchmark*: Real-world uptime SLAs from leading cloud providers.
  - *Decision Guide*: Evaluate single-region vs. multi-region deployments.

- **Durability**
  - *Metric*: Data loss not exceeding 1 in 1 billion transactions.
  - *Benchmark*: Redundant storage solutions with automatic replication.
  - *Decision Guide*: Necessary for systems requiring permanent message storage.

- **Security**
  - *Metric*: AES-256 encryption for all data transfers.
  - *Benchmark*: Compliance with ISO 27001/27017 standards.
  - *Decision Guide*: Mandated for industries dealing with sensitive data.

- **Maintainability**
  - *Metric*: Ability to deploy updates with zero downtime.
  - *Benchmark*: Use of CI/CD pipelines for seamless integrations.
  - *Decision Guide*: Requires high reliability and frequent updates.

- **Portability**
  - *Metric*: Deployment possible across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
  - *Benchmark*: Use of containers for consistent deployment experience.
  - *Decision Guide*: Considerations for multi-cloud strategy or hybrid environments.

- **Compliance**
  - *Metric*: Complete alignment with regulatory standards like GDPR and HIPAA.
  - *Benchmark*: Regular compliance audits and certifications.
  - *Decision Guide*: Essential for legal and regulatory adherence.

- **Cost Constraints**
  - *Metric*: Total cost under predetermined budget constraints.
  - *Benchmark*: Cost optimization strategies balancing quality and investment.
  - *Decision Guide*: Decision influenced heavily by operational budgets and cost-benefit analyses.
