## Detailed Mapping Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Platform

**Functional Requirements**:
- Message Delivery: Order processing → **Apache Kafka** (exactly-once delivery)
- Integration: Multiple payment gateways → **REST APIs + Message queues**
- Persistence: Order history → **Kafka with long retention**

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Scalability: Black Friday traffic → **Kafka with auto-scaling**
- Latency: Real-time inventory updates → **< 100ms acceptable**
- Reliability: 99.9% order processing → **Multi-zone deployment**

### Example 2: IoT Sensor Network

**Functional Requirements**:
- Message Delivery: Sensor data → **MQTT** (lightweight protocol)
- Integration: Cloud analytics → **MQTT to Kafka bridge**
- Routing: Geographic filtering → **Topic-based routing**

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Throughput: 100K sensors → **MQTT + Kafka backend**
- Latency: Alert processing → **< 1 second acceptable**
- Cost: Budget-conscious → **Open-source solutions**

### Example 3: Financial Trading System

**Functional Requirements**:
- Message Delivery: Trade execution → **Solace** (guaranteed delivery)
- Authentication: Regulatory compliance → **Multi-factor authentication**
- Monitoring: Real-time dashboards → **Built-in monitoring tools**

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Latency: High-frequency trading → **< 1ms required**
- Reliability: Zero tolerance for failures → **99.999% uptime**
- Compliance: Financial regulations → **SOX, MiFID II compliance**

## Requirements Prioritization Framework

### Priority Matrix

| Requirement Category | Business Impact | Technical Complexity | Implementation Cost | Priority Score |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Message Delivery** | High (9) | Medium (5) | Medium (5) | **High (19)** |
| **Scalability** | High (9) | High (8) | High (8) | **High (25)** |
| **Security** | High (9) | Medium (6) | Medium (6) | **High (21)** |
| **Latency** | Variable (7) | High (8) | High (7) | **Medium (22)** |
| **Cost** | High (9) | Low (3) | High (9) | **High (21)** |
| **Integration** | Medium (6) | Medium (5) | Medium (5) | **Medium (16)** |
| **Compliance** | Variable (8) | Medium (6) | Medium (6) | **Medium (20)** |
| **Portability** | Low (4) | Medium (5) | Medium (5) | **Low (14)** |

### Trade-off Analysis

#### Common Trade-offs:

1. **Performance vs. Cost**
   - High-performance solutions (Solace, IBM MQ) cost more
   - Budget solutions (open-source) require more operational overhead
   - **Recommendation**: Balance based on business criticality

2. **Reliability vs. Complexity**
   - Highly reliable systems require complex configurations
   - Simple systems may not meet reliability requirements
   - **Recommendation**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

3. **Scalability vs. Resource Usage**
   - Scalable systems consume more resources
   - Resource-efficient systems may not scale well
   - **Recommendation**: Plan for growth, optimize later

4. **Security vs. Performance**
   - Strong security adds latency and complexity
   - Performance optimization may compromise security
   - **Recommendation**: Security is non-negotiable, optimize within constraints

5. **Flexibility vs. Performance**
   - Flexible systems support multiple patterns but may be slower
   - Specialized systems are faster but less adaptable
   - **Recommendation**: Choose based on long-term architecture goals
