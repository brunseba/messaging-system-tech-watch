### Legend \& Notes

- **Kubernetes Operator:**
    - **Yes (Official):** Official operator provided by project or company
    - **Yes (Strimzi, Confluent):** Leading community/enterprise operators for Kafka
    - **Varies by broker:** For MQTT, depends on broker (e.g., EMQX, Mosquitto)
    - **No (AWS managed):** AWS managed services do not run inside Kubernetes
- **Licence Type:** Open source or proprietary
- **Cost:** Free for open source/self-hosted; managed/enterprise solutions are paid
- **Learning Curve:** Ranges from easy (simple, managed) to steep (complex, enterprise)
- **Typical Use Cases:** Most common and recommended scenarios
