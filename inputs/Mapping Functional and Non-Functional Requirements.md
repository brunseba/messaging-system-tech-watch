# Mapping Functional and Non-Functional Requirements to Messaging System Comparison Tables

Below is a comprehensive mapping of **functional** and **non-functional requirements** to the features and criteria presented in the previous messaging system comparison tables. This mapping clarifies how each requirement aligns with key architectural patterns, product features, and evaluation criteria.

#### 1. Mapping to Messaging System Architectures and Products

| Requirement Type | Example Requirement | Relevant Architecture/Feature/Product Column |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Functional | Message Delivery | All architectures (Pub-Sub, Fanout, etc.), all products |
| Functional | Supported Messaging Patterns | "Architecture fit", "Supported Messaging Patterns" |
| Functional | Integration (APIs/Protocols) | "Integration", "Product Description \& Use Cases" |
| Functional | Message Routing | "Routing", "Product Notable Features" |
| Functional | Persistence | "Durability", "Persistence" |
| Functional | Error Handling | "Reliability", "Error Handling" |
| Functional | User Authentication | "Security", "Access Controls" |
| Functional | Monitoring and Logging | "Administration Tools", "Monitoring" |
| Functional | Administration Tools | "Administration Tools", "Product Features" |
| Non-Functional | Scalability | "Scalability", "Horizontally scalable", "Globally scalable" |
| Non-Functional | Latency | "Low latency", "Latency and throughput" |
| Non-Functional | Throughput | "High throughput", "Latency and throughput" |
| Non-Functional | Reliability | "Reliability", "Guarantees about message delivery" |
| Non-Functional | Availability | "Availability", "System uptime" |
| Non-Functional | Durability | "Durability", "Persistence" |
| Non-Functional | Security | "Security", "Encryption", "Access Controls" |
| Non-Functional | Maintainability | "Maintainability", "Ease of updates" |
| Non-Functional | Portability | "Portability", "Cloud vs. on-premises" |
| Non-Functional | Compliance | "Compliance", "Industry standards" |
| Non-Functional | Cost Constraints | "Cost and licensing", "Pricing model" |

#### 2. Mapping to the Summary Feature Table

| Feature/Need | Functional/Non-Functional | Example Requirement |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Real-time Communication | Functional | Message Delivery |
| Data-driven Decision | Functional | Message Routing, Filtering |
| Interpretability | Non-Functional | Transparency, Monitoring |
| Predictive Modeling | Functional | Routing, Filtering |
| Workflow Automation | Functional | Integration, Event Triggers |
| Group Collaboration | Functional | Message Delivery, Channels |
| Transparency of Logic | Non-Functional | Monitoring, Logging |

#### 3. Example: Requirements Matrix

| Requirement Type | Example Requirement | Mapped Table Column/Feature |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Functional | Routing | "Message Routing", "Feature/Need" |
| Functional | Integration | "Integration", "Workflow Automation" |
| Non-Functional | Scalability | "Scalability", "Throughput" |
| Non-Functional | Security | "Security", "Transparency of Logic" |

### Summary

- **Functional requirements** (what the system does) align with architectural patterns, supported features, and integration capabilities in the tables.
- **Non-functional requirements** (how the system performs) map to scalability, reliability, latency, security, and other quality attributes highlighted in the comparison tables.
- Use these mappings to guide evaluation and selection of messaging systems based on both business needs and technical constraints.
